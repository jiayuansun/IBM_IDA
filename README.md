IBM_IDA
This repo has the code I created to facilitate the development using IDA (Infosphere Data Architect) as it's obsoleted by IBM , 
no kidding I posted a question on IBM IDA forum for 3 weeks no one responded! SAD!

PrintFieldCategroy.java , this file printed out all the field in a logical model .
ColorField.java , this code highlighted the required field .

update:2017/04/10
I created a GUI interface for this will update soon
